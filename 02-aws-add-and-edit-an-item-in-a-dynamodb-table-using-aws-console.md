# [Add and edit an item in a DynamoDB table using AWS Console](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-add-and-edit-an-item-in-a-dynamodb-table-using-aws-console?pl=learn-aws-dynamodb-from-scratch-21c3)

- We can create items directly in the AWS Console

- Click Create Item in the items pane of the DynamoDB console.

- We only _have_ to provide our primary key as the type that we provided when we created the table - every item has to have a unique lesson title

- As a NoSQL DB, we can add any field we want and use any type.

- It is fine for some items not to have fields that others do not.

## Personal Take

The console is so clunky but it's a good way to quickly add and remove data. Also, the list of field types is handy instead of having to look up the API documentation.
