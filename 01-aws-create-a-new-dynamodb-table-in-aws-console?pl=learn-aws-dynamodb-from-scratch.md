# [Create a new DynamoDB table in AWS Console](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-create-a-new-dynamodb-table-in-aws-console?pl=learn-aws-dynamodb-from-scratch-21c3)

- Find the service in the console, either by searching or in the database section.

- DynamoDB is a scaleable and fast (single digit latency) NoSQL DB.

- Create database

  - Table name (3-255 characters)
  - Primary key: The tableâ€™s primary key is made up of one or two attributes that uniquely identify items, partition the data, and sort data within each partition.
  - The rest of the options are find to leave as default

- Once provisioned you can check that the details match the configuration.

- If you click over to items you can see that there are no items yet - every DynamoDB instance starts of empty and clean.

## Personal Take

It's so easy to get up and going with a DB. Really clear explanation of how to do it here and explaining a few of the options.
